⚙️ Node.js & Next.js Practice Repository
This repository contains my hands-on practice and learning experiments with Node.js, Next.js, and related web technologies.

📚 What’s Inside
The repository is divided into multiple folders representing key focus areas:
| Folder / File Group | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `routing_next/`     | Experiments with dynamic routing, static file serving, and ES modules in Node.js     |
| `advance_next/`     | Practicing advanced concepts in Next.js like App directory, layouts, and API routes  |
| `new_next/`         | Setup with **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and Next.js routing, forms, and styling |
| `pages/api/`        | Backend API routes created using Next.js (e.g., `login.ts`, `example.ts`)            |
| Standalone Files    | Basic servers (`server.js`, `sendingFile_server.js`), utility modules, HTML samples  |

🛠️ Technologies Used
Node.js
Next.js (v13+ App Router and Pages Router)
TypeScript
Tailwind CSS
ES Modules & File System (fs)
Express.js (custom server setups)

✅ Key Learning Areas

📁 Dynamic Routing in Next.js ([...page].tsx)
🔄 API Integration with Express & Next.js backend
🧱 Layout and Styling: Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, SCSS
🌐 Static and dynamic page generation
🧪 Working with file I/O in Node.js
⚙️ Module import/export patterns (.mjs, require, import)
📦 Configs: next.config.mjs, tsconfig.json, etc.

🚀 Purpose
This repository serves as a sandbox for practicing modern full-stack JavaScript, and a growing reference for building scalable, modular applications using Node.js + Next.js.

📝 Note: This is a personal learning workspace. All examples are experimental.
